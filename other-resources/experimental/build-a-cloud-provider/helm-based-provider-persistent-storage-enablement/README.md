# Helm Based Provider Persistent Storage Enablement

## **Overview**

At Akash we use the Kubernetes Rook Operator coupled with the Ceph distributed file system to provision Provider persistent storage.

Refer to the [Akash Provider](../../../../providers/build-a-cloud-provider/akash-cloud-provider-build-with-helm-charts/) guide if your provider has not yet been built.

We encourage becoming familiar with Rook and Ceph prior to configuring Akash persistent storage via this [guide](https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/v1.9/). The current persistent storage use is based on the Rook Ceph helm chart.

Please take into consideration the following Akash recommendations:

* Persistent storage should only be enabled on Kubernetes nodes that are NOT serving as control-plane/master nodes. This does not apply if you are running all-in-one node deployment.
* Ceph will only deploy itâ€™s BlueStore on unformatted volumes. A node must have unformatted volumes mounted to serve persistent storage capabilities.
* Ceph uses BlueStore as its default backend to store the objects in a monolithic database-like fashion.
* To read more on Ceph Architecture go [here](https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/architecture/).
