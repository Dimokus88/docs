# STEP 7 - Additional Verifications

As desired consider additional verifications covered in the [Akash Provider Troubleshooting ](../../../../providers/akash-provider-troubleshooting/)documentation.

Among the topics covered in the troubleshooting guide that should be considered for your new provider verifications:

* [Provider Lease Verifications and Management](../../../../providers/akash-provider-troubleshooting/provider-lease-management.md)
* [Provider Manifest Verifications and Management](../../../../providers/akash-provider-troubleshooting/provider-manifests.md)
* [Provider Earnings Review](../../../../providers/akash-provider-troubleshooting/provider-earnings.md)
